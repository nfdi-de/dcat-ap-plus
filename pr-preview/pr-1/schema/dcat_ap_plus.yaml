description: 'This metadata schema is an Extension of the DCAT Application Profile

  for Providing Links to Use-case Specific Context. It allows to provide additional

  metadata regarding: which kind(s) of entity(s) or activity(s) were evaluated (the

  dcat:Dataset is about), which kind of activity generated the dcat:Dataset, which

  kind of instruments were used in the dataset generating activity, in which surrounding

  (e.g. a laboratory) and according to which plan the dataset generating activity

  took place, as well as regarding which kind(s) of qualitative and quantitative characteristic

  were attributed to the evaluated entity or evaluated activity and to the used instruments.'
